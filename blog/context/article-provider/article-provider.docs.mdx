The Apollo GraphQL provider for Contentful blog data simplifies the way you interact with Contentful's powerful CMS, providing an efficient and developer-friendly interface to access and manage your blog content.

This provider offers access to a built-in mock data provider, enabling you to develop, test, and debug your application without requiring live Contentful access. This ensures your development pipeline remains efficient and uninterrupted.

```ts
() => (
  // Replace `spaceId` with your Contentful space ID or pass `null` to use the mock data provider.
  <ApolloBlogProvider spaceId={null}>
    <BlogList />
  </ApolloBlogProvider>
);
```
